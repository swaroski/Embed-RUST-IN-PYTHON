Boosting Python Packages' Speed with Rust: A Guide to Lightning-Fast Performance

Introduction:
Python's versatility is renowned, but when it comes to speed, it's not always the front-runner. Many data science libraries turn to C for number-crunching tasks, but dealing with C can be like navigating a minefield of segfaults and memory leaks. What if you could have the best of both worlds? Enter Rust, a language known for its blazing speed, memory efficiency, and safety. In this guide, we'll show you how to harness Rust's power to supercharge your Python packages.

Getting Started:
To kickstart your journey, begin by installing Maturin with a simple `pip install maturin` Next, navigate to the `rustic` directory and execute `maturin develop`. This command not only builds your Rust code but also installs the Python package in development mode, ensuring it works seamlessly in your current environment. With everything set up, you can dive into benchmarking by running `python main.py`.

Prepare to be amazed as your Python packages reach new levels of performance with Rust by their side. Say goodbye to sluggish code and hello to lightning-fast execution!

The main difference between `maturin develop` and `maturin develop --release` lies in how the Rust code is compiled and optimized when integrating a Rust extension into a Python project.

**maturin develop**:

This command builds the Rust code with debugging information and optimizations disabled.
It's typically used during the development phase when you want to iterate quickly, debug the Rust code, and have meaningful error messages.
The resulting Rust code may not be as optimized for performance as it could be.

**maturin develop --release**:

This command builds the Rust code with optimizations enabled for release.
It's used when you're preparing your Python package for production or release.
The resulting Rust code is optimized for performance, potentially resulting in faster execution times.
However, the trade-off is that debugging and error messages may be less informative because some debugging information is stripped during optimization.
